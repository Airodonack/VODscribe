# Changelog

What changed in each release, for people who use VODscribe. The entry for the version being released is also the release notes in `latest.json` (`scripts/release.py` reads it), so write it for them, not for developers. The newest release is first; a version still being worked on is marked "(unreleased)".

## 0.2.1 (unreleased)

- The timeline appears as soon as chat is in, even before the transcript has its first line, and scrolls through the part still waiting to be transcribed.
- Settings and the search's From filter open above everything, like the Timeline panel, so a playing video or a short window can't cover or cut them off.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-13

- Chat: for Kick, Twitch and YouTube livestreams, the chat replay sits beside the transcript, each line with the messages sent while it was said, emotes and all. Hide it with the Chat button. It's fetched in the background, shows as it arrives, and carries on where it stopped if interrupted.
- Search covers chat too. The From button by the search box chooses audio, chat or both, and this VOD or all of them; choosing All VODs keeps it there as you switch VODs.
- A timeline beside the transcript shows how busy chat was over the whole VOD. Click or drag on it to go there.
- Timeline layers mark the moments you care about: laughter, hype and "clip it" to start, or any words and emotes, for every channel or one. Up to three show at once, and their messages are highlighted in chat.
- Subs, gifts and tips (bits, KICKs, Super Chats and memberships) are marked in chat, and can be shown on the timeline, stronger where more money changed hands.
- Long VODs with busy chats open, scroll and jump around quickly.
- Removing or re-transcribing a VOD shows that it's under way, and the rest of the app keeps working meanwhile.
- No white flash when the app opens.
- Fixes: the GPU add-on's progress shows when Settings is reopened mid-download.

## 0.1.3 — 2026-10-13

- Setup and the GPU add-on downloads have a Cancel button. Tools and model files that finished stay; the GPU add-on's own pack starts over.
- The GPU add-on is smaller: it now contains only ONNX Runtime and NVIDIA's libraries, since the speech-recognition library ships with the app. It downloads again once after updating.
- Settings has a Help section with where to report problems, and the website answers the same question.
- Under the hood: a weekly check that every file setup downloads is still available where it's expected.
- A YouTube download that the site refused is tried again from a fresh lookup before it's reported, since YouTube sometimes refuses the first.
- VODscribe's code is public, under the Functional Source License (source-available; Apache 2.0 two years after each release).
- Downloaded installers carry the version in their file name, like VODscribe-0.1.3-windows-x64-setup.exe.
- A copy that wasn't installed from a package (built from source, say) says so when asked to check for updates, instead of an error about platforms.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-10-12

- Downloads with several files show which one is under way, like "(3 of 5)".
- Settings no longer scrolls sideways.
- Download sizes are exact.
- Under the hood: SvelteKit 3 and more tests.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-10-12

- Fixes YouTube and Twitch playback in the installed app.
- Linux downloads are .deb and .rpm only.
- Opening VODscribe twice brings up the open window.
- Downloads work on Windows for users with non-ASCII names.
- Several smaller fixes.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-12

First release.
